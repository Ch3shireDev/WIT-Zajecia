HERE is Edward Bear coming downstairs now bump bump  bump on the back of his head behind Christopher Robin It is  as far as he knows the only way of coming downstairs but sometimes he feels that there really is another way if only he could stop bumping for a moment and think of it   And then he feels that perhaps there isn t Anyhow  here he is at the bottom and ready to be introduced to you  Winnie the Pooh      When I first heard his name I said just as you are going to say But I thought he was a boy?   So did I said Christopher Robin   Then you can t call him Winnie   I don t   But you said   He s Winnie ther Pooh Don t you know what ther  means   Ah yes now I do I said quickly; and I hope you do too because it is all the explanation you are going to get   Sometimes Winnie the Pooh likes a game of some sort when he comes downstairs and sometimes he likes to sit quietly in front of the fire and listen to a story This evening   What about a story said Christopher Robin   What about a story I said   Could you very sweetly tell Winnie the Pooh one   I suppose I could I said What sort of stories does he like   About himself Because he s that sort of Bear   Oh I see   So could you very sweetly   I ll try I said   So I tried    Once upon a time a very long time ago now about last Friday Winnie the Pooh lived in a forest all by himself under the name of Sanders   What does under the name mean asked Christopher Robin It means he had the name over the door in gold letters  and lived under it   Winnie the Pooh wasn t quite sure said Christopher Robin   Now I am said a growly voice   Then I will go on said I    One day when he was out walking he came to an open place in the middle of the forest and in the middle of this place was a large oak tree and from the top of the tree  there came a loud buzzing noise   Winnie the Pooh sat down at the foot of the tree put his head between his paws and began to think   First of all he said to himself: That buzzing noise means something You don t get a buzzing noise like that just buzzing and buzzing without its meaning something If there s a buzzing noise somebody s making a buzzing noise and the only reason for making a buzzing noise that I know of is because you re a bee   Then he thought another long time and said: And the only reason for being a bee that I know of is making honey   And then he got up and said: And the only reason for making honey is so as I can eat it So he began to climb the tree  He climbed and he climbed and he climbed and as he climbed he sang a little song to himself It went like this:   Isn t it funny How a bear likes honey  Buzz Buzz Buzz  I wonder why he does    Then he climbed a little further and a little further and then just a little further By that time he had thought of another song     It s a very funny thought that if Bears were Bees  They d build their nests at the bottom of trees  And that being so if the Bees were Bears  We shouldn t have to climb up all these stairs     He was getting rather tired by this time so that is why he sang a Complaining Song He was nearly there now and if he just s t o o d o n t h a t branch   Crack   Oh help said Pooh as he dropped ten feet on the branch below him   If only I hadn t he said as he bounced twenty feet on to the next branch   You see what I meant to do he explained as he turned head over heels and crashed on to another branch thirty feet below what I meant to do   Of course it was rather he admitted as he slithered very quickly through the next six branches   It all comes I suppose he decided as he said good bye to the last branch spun round three times and flew gracefully into a gorse bush it all comes of liking honey so much Oh help   He crawled out of the gorse bush brushed the prickles from his nose and began to think again And the first person he thought of was Christopher Robin   Was that me said Christopher Robin in an awed voice hardly daring to believe it   That was you   Christopher Robin said nothing but his eyes got larger and larger and his face got pinker and pinker   So Winnie the Pooh went round to his friend Christopher Robin who lived behind a green door in another part of the Forest   Good morning Christopher Robin he said   Good morning Winnie ther Pooh said you   I wonder if you ve got such a thing as a balloon about you   A balloon   Yes I just said to myself coming along: I wonder if Christopher Robin has such a thing as a balloon about him I just said it to myself thinking of balloons and wondering   What do you want a balloon for you said   Winnie the Pooh looked round to see that nobody was listening put his paw to his mouth and said in a deep whisper: Honey   But you don t get honey with balloons   I do said Pooh   Well it just happened that you had been to a party the day before at the house of your friend Piglet and you had balloons at the party You had had a big green balloon; and one of Rabbit s relations had had a big blue one and had left it behind being really too young to go to a party at all; and so you had brought the green one and the blue one home with you   Which one would you like you asked Pooh He put his head between his paws and thought very carefully   It s like this he said When you go after honey with a balloon the great thing is not to let the bees know you re coming Now if you have a green balloon they might think you were only part of the tree and not notice you and if you have a blue balloon they might think you were only part of the sky and not notice you and the question is: Which is most likely   Wouldn t they notice you underneath the balloon you asked   They might or they might not said Winnie the Pooh  You never can tell with bees He thought for a moment and said: I shall try to look like a small black cloud That will deceive them   Then you had better have the blue balloon you said; and so it was decided   Well you both went out with the blue balloon and you took your gun with you just in case as you always did and Winnie the Pooh went to a very muddy place that he knew of and rolled and rolled until he was black all over; and then when the balloon was blown up as big as big and you and Pooh were both holding on to the string you let go suddenly and Pooh Bear floated gracefully up into the sky and stayed there  level with the top of the tree and about twenty feet away from it   Hooray you shouted   Isn t that fine shouted Winnie the Pooh down to you  What do I look like   You look like a Bear holding on to a balloon you said   Not said Pooh anxiously not like a small black cloud in a blue sky   Not very much   Ah well perhaps from up here it looks different  And as I say you never can tell with bees   There was no wind to blow him nearer to the tree so there he stayed He could see the honey he could smell the honey but he couldn t quite reach the honey   After a little while he called down to you   Christopher Robin he said in a loud whisper   Hallo   I think the bees suspect something   What sort of thing   I don t know But something tells me that they re suspicious   Perhaps they think that you re after their honey   It may be that You never can tell with bees   There was another little silence and then he called down to you again   Christopher Robin   Yes   Have you an umbrella in your house   I think so   I wish you would bring it out here and walk up and down with it and look up at me every now and then and say Tut tut it looks like rain I think if you did that it would help the deception which we are practising on these bees   Well you laughed to yourself Silly old Bear but you didn t say it aloud because you were so fond of him and you went home for your umbrella   Oh there you are called down Winnie the Pooh as soon as you got back to the tree I was beginning to get anxious I have discovered that the bees are now definitely Suspicious   Shall I put my umbrella up you said   Yes but wait a moment We must be practical The important bee to deceive is the Queen Bee Can you see which is the Queen Bee from down there   No   A pity Well now if you walk up and down with your umbrella saying Tut tut it looks like rain I shall do what I can by singing a little Cloud Song such as a cloud might sing Go   So while you walked up and down and wondered if it would rain Winnie the Pooh sang this song:   How sweet to be a Cloud Floating in the Blue  Every little cloud Always sings aloud  How sweet to be a Cloud Floating in the Blue  It makes him very proud To be a little cloud    The bees were still buzzing as suspiciously as ever  Some of them indeed left their nests and flew all round the cloud as it began the second verse of this song and one bee sat down on the nose of the cloud for a moment and then got up again   Christopher ow Robin called out the cloud   Yes   I have just been thinking and I have come to a very important decision These are the wrong sort of bees   Are they   Quite the wrong sort So I should think they would make the wrong sort of honey shouldn t you   Would they   Yes So I think I shall come down   How asked you   Winnie the Pooh hadn t thought about this If he let go of the string he would fall bump and he didn t like the idea of that So he thought for a long time and then he said:  Christopher Robin you must shoot the balloon with your gun Have you got your gun   Of course I have you said But if I do that it will spoil the balloon you said But if you don t said Pooh  I shall have to let go and that would spoil me   When he put it like this you saw how it was and you aimed very carefully at the balloon and fired   Ow said Pooh   Did I miss you asked   You didn t exactly miss said Pooh but you missed the balloon   I m so sorry you said and you fired again and this time you hit the balloon and the air came slowly out and Winnie the Pooh floated down to the ground      But his arms were so stiff from holding on to the string of the balloon all that time that they stayed up straight in the air for more than a week and whenever a fly came and settled on his nose he had to blow it off And I think but I am not sure that that is why he was always called Pooh     Is that the end of the story asked Christopher Robin   That s the end of that one There are others   About Pooh and Me   And Piglet and Rabbit and all of you Don t you remember   I do remember and then when I try to remember I forget   That day when Pooh and Piglet tried to catch the Heffalump   They didn t catch it did they   No   Pooh couldn t because he hasn t any brain Did I catch it   Well that comes into the story   Christopher Robin nodded   I do remember he said only Pooh doesn t very well  so that s why he likes having it told to him again Because then it s a real story and not just a remembering   That s just how I feel I said   Christopher Robin gave a deep sigh picked his Bear up by the leg and walked off to the door trailing Pooh behind him At the door he turned and said Coming to see me have my bath I didn t hurt him when I shot him did I Not a bit  He nodded and went out and in a moment I heard Winnie the Pooh bump bump bump going up the stairs behind him
