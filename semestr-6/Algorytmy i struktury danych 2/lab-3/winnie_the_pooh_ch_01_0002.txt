 chapter i

in which we are introduced to winnie the pooh and some bees  and the

stories begin

here is edward bear coming downstairs now  bump  bump  bump  on the back of his head  behind christopher robin  it is  as far as he knows  the

only way of coming downstairs  but sometimes he feels that there really is another way  if only he could stop bumping for a moment and think of it winniewinnie

and then he feels that perhaps there isn t  anyhow  here he is at the bottom  and ready to be introduced to you  winnie the pooh 

when i first heard his name  i said  just as you are going to say   but i thought he was a boy  winnwinniepooh

 so did i   said christopher robin 

 then you can t call him winnie  winniewinnie

 i don t  

 but you said   winnwinniepooh

 he s winnie ther pooh  don t you know what  ther  means  winniewinnie

 ah  yes  now i do   i said quickly  and i hope you do too  because it is all the explanation you are going to get 

sometimes winnie the pooh likes a game of some sort when he comes downstairs  and sometimes he likes to sit quietly in front of the fire and listen to a story  this evening  

 what about a story   said christopher robin winniewinnie

 what about a story   i said 

 could you very sweetly tell winnie the pooh one  winniewinnie

 i suppose i could   i said   what sort of stories does he like  

 about himself  because he s that sort of bear  

 oh  i see  

 so could you very sweetly  

 i ll try   i said winnwinniepooh

so i tried winniewinnie

once upon a time  a very long time ago now  about last friday  winnie the pooh lived in a forest all by himself under the name of sanders 

  what does  under the name  mean   asked christopher robin   it means he had the name over the door in gold letters  and lived under it  

 winnie the pooh wasn t quite sure   said christopher robin 

 now i am   said a growly voice winniewinnie

 then i will go on   said i  winnwinniepooh

one day when he was out walking  he came to an open place in the middle of the forest  and in the middle of this place was a large oak tree  and  from the top of the tree  there came a loud buzzing noise 

winnie the pooh sat down at the foot of the tree  put his head between his paws and began to think 

first of all he said to himself   that buzzing noise means something  you don t get a buzzing noise like that  just buzzing and buzzing  without its meaning something  if there s a buzzing noise  somebody s making a buzzing noise  and the only reason for making a buzzing noise that i know of is because you re a bee  

then he thought another long time  and said   and the only reason for being a bee that i know of is making honey  

and then he got up  and said   and the only reason for making honey is so as i can eat it   so he began to climb the tree

he climbed and he climbed and he climbed and as he climbed he sang a little song to himself  it went like this winnwinniepooh

isn t it funny winniewinnie winnwinniepooh

how a bear likes honey 

buzz  buzz  buzz winniewinniewinniewinnie

i wonder why he does winnwinniepooh

then he climbed a little further      and a little further       and then just a little further  by that time he had thought of another song 

it s a very funny thought that  if bears were bees 

they d build their nests at the bottom of trees 

and that being so  if the bees were bears  

we shouldn t have to climb up all these stairs 

he was getting rather tired by this time  so that is why he sang a complaining song  he was nearly there now  and if he just s t o o d o n t h a t branch      

crack  

 oh  help   said pooh  as he dropped ten feet on the branch below him 

 if only i hadn t    he said  as he bounced twenty feet on to the next branch 

 you see  what i meant to do   he explained  as he turned head over heels  and crashed on to another branch thirty feet below   what i meant to do   

 of course  it was rather    he admitted  as he slithered very quickly through the next six branches 

 it all comes  i suppose   he decided  as he said good bye to the last branch  spun round three times  and flew gracefully into a gorse bush   it all comes of liking honey so much  oh  help  

he crawled out of the gorse bush  brushed the prickles from his nose  and began to think again  and the first person he thought of was christopher robin 

  was that me   said christopher robin in an awed voice  hardly daring to believe it 

 that was you  

christopher robin said nothing  but his eyes got larger and larger  and his face got pinker and pinker  

so winnie the pooh went round to his friend christopher robin  who lived behind a green door in another part of the forest 

 good morning  christopher robin   he said 

 good morning  winnie ther pooh   said you 

 i wonder if you ve got such a thing as a balloon about you  

 a balloon  

 yes  i just said to myself coming along   i wonder if christopher robin has such a thing as a balloon about him   i just said it to myself  thinking of balloons  and wondering  

 what do you want a balloon for   you said 

winnie the pooh looked round to see that nobody was listening  put his paw to his mouth  and said in a deep whisper   honey  

 but you don t get honey with balloons  

 i do   said pooh 

well  it just happened that you had been to a party the day before at the house of your friend piglet  and you had balloons at the party  you had had a big green balloon  and one of rabbit s relations had had a big blue one  and had left it behind  being really too young to go to a party at all  and so you had brought the green one and the blue one home with you 

 which one would you like   you asked pooh  he put his head between his paws and thought very carefully 

 it s like this   he said   when you go after honey with a balloon  the great thing is not to let the bees know you re coming  now  if you have a

green balloon  they might think you were only part of the tree  and not notice you  and if you have a blue balloon  they might think you were only part of the sky  and not notice you  and the question is  which is most likely  

 wouldn t they notice you underneath the balloon   you asked 

 they might or they might not   said winnie the pooh   you never can tell with bees   he thought for a moment and said   i shall try to look like a small black cloud  that will deceive them  

 then you had better have the blue balloon   you said  and so it was decided 

well  you both went out with the blue balloon  and you took your gun with you  just in case  as you always did  and winnie the pooh went to a very muddy place that he knew of  and rolled and rolled until he was black all over  and then  when the balloon was blown up as big as big  and you and pooh were both holding on to the string  you let go suddenly  and pooh bear floated gracefully up into the sky  and stayed there  level with the top of the tree and about twenty feet away from it 

 hooray   you shouted 

 isn t that fine   shouted winnie the pooh down to you   what do i look like  

 you look like a bear holding on to a balloon   you said 

 not   said pooh anxiously     not like a small black cloud in a blue sky  

 not very much  

 ah  well  perhaps from up here it looks different  and  as i say  you never can tell with bees  

there was no wind to blow him nearer to the tree  so there he stayed  he could see the honey  he could smell the honey  but he couldn t quite reach the honey 

after a little while he called down to you 

 christopher robin   he said in a loud whisper 

 hallo  

 i think the bees suspect something  

 what sort of thing  

 i don t know  but something tells me that they re suspicious  

 perhaps they think that you re after their honey  

 it may be that  you never can tell with bees  

there was another little silence  and then he called down to you again 

 christopher robin  

 yes  

 have you an umbrella in your house  

 i think so  

 i wish you would bring it out here  and walk up and down with it  and look up at me every now and then  and say  tut tut  it looks like rain   i think  if you did that  it would help the deception which we are practising on these bees  

well  you laughed to yourself   silly old bear    but you didn t say it aloud because you were so fond of him  and you went home for your umbrella 

 oh  there you are   called down winnie the pooh  as soon as you got back to the tree   i was beginning to get anxious  i have discovered that the bees are now definitely suspicious  

 shall i put my umbrella up   you said 

 yes  but wait a moment  we must be practical  the important bee to deceive is the queen bee  can you see which is the queen bee from down

there  

 no  

 a pity  well  now  if you walk up and down with your umbrella  saying   tut tut  it looks like rain   i shall do what i can by singing a little cloud song  such as a cloud might sing        go  

so  while you walked up and down and wondered if it would rain  winnie the pooh sang this song 

how sweet to be a cloud

floating in the blue 

every little cloud

always sings aloud 

 how sweet to be a cloud

floating in the blue  

it makes him very proud

to be a little cloud 

the bees were still buzzing as suspiciously as ever  some of them  indeed  left their nests and flew all round the cloud as it began the second verse of this song  and one bee sat down on the nose of the cloud for a moment  and then got up again 

 christopher  ow   robin   called out the cloud 

 yes  

 i have just been thinking  and i have come to a very important decision  these are the wrong sort of bees  

 are they  

 quite the wrong sort  so i should think they would make the wrong sort of honey  shouldn t you  

 would they  

 yes  so i think i shall come down  

 how   asked you 

winnie the pooh hadn t thought about this  if he let go of the string  he would fall  bump  and he didn t like the idea of that  so he thought for a long time  and then he said 

 christopher robin  you must shoot the balloon with your gun  have you got your gun  

 of course i have   you said   but if i do that  it will spoil the balloon   you said  but if you don t  said pooh   i shall have to let go  and that would spoil me  

when he put it like this  you saw how it was  and you aimed very carefully at the balloon  and fired 

 ow   said pooh 

 did i miss   you asked 

 you didn t exactly miss   said pooh   but you missed the balloon  

 i m so sorry   you said  and you fired again  and this time you hit the balloon and the air came slowly out  and winnie the pooh floated down to the ground 

but his arms were so stiff from holding on to the string of the balloon all that time that they stayed up straight in the air for more than a week  and whenever a fly came and settled on his nose he had to blow it off  and i think  but i am not sure  that that is why he was always called pooh 

 is that the end of the story   asked christopher robin 

 that s the end of that one  there are others  

 about pooh and me  

 and piglet and rabbit and all of you  don t you remember  

 i do remember  and then when i try to remember  i forget  

 that day when pooh and piglet tried to catch the heffalump   

 they didn t catch it  did they  

 no  

 pooh couldn t  because he hasn t any brain  did i catch it  

 well  that comes into the story  

christopher robin nodded 

 i do remember   he said   only pooh doesn t very well  so that s why he likes having it told to him again  because then it s a real story and not just a remembering  

 that s just how i feel   i said 

christopher robin gave a deep sigh  picked his bear up by the leg  and walked off to the door  trailing pooh behind him  at the door he turned and said   coming to see me have my bath    i didn t hurt him when i shot him  did i    not a bit   he nodded and went out  and in a moment i heard winnie the pooh  bump  bump  bump  going up the stairs behind him
